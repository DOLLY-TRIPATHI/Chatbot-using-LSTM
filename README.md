# Chatbot-using-LSTM


Chatbot using LSTM is an AI-powered conversational system that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to understand and respond to user queries. Unlike traditional chatbots, which rely on rule-based logic, LSTM chatbots can learn from conversation data and capture contextual information over time. This allows the chatbot to provide more natural, relevant, and coherent responses.

Key Features:

Processes sequential text data effectively.

Learns long-term dependencies in conversations.

Generates context-aware responses.

Can be trained on custom datasets for domain-specific tasks.

Use Cases:

Customer support automation

Virtual assistants

Educational tutoring bots

Personal assistants
